<h1>8 Bit NFTs</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
A newsletter email I designed and coded for a fictional NFT Crypto newsletter. I have an affinity for 8 bit art and 80's pop culture and so I wanted to mix the old with the new. The email is responsive and should work on most email clients. I used HTML, CSS, and Photoshop to create the email and Email on Acid to test it on different email clients.
